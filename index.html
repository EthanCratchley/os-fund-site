            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>When we started Laurea Capital we had two main goals in mind. First to explore the possibilities of hybrid investing, the amount of research and investing with a hybrid approach is very minimal. Maybe that is because it sucks or maybe because it is difficult to maintain. Regardless, we want to try it and hopefully find success with it.</p>
            <p>Second, to open the curtains to the private world of investing and hedge funds. Hedge funds and investing are often seen as secretive, difficult, and dirty. This does not need to be the case and here at Laurea we hope to educate and take input from others on how to improve.</p>
            <p>After extensive research, studying of the giants before us and endless testing of algorithms, we were finally able to begin crafting each of <a href="#funds">our funds</a>. Each fund portfolio aims to be at a specific risk level based on our <a href="philosophy.html">company's philosophy</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Alongside managing our portfolios, Laurea participates in extensive research on different financial instruments, commodities, and the overall market. All of this research is what helps us make our investing decisions, algorithm optimization, and it's all made open to the public.</p>
            <p>Laurea Capital is dedicated to continuous learning and adaptation, striving to achieve exceptional returns while maintaining a commitment to transparency and education for our investors. </p>
